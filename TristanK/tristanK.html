    <h3> About me</h3>
    <p> Hello my name is Tristan, and i'm the creator of this webpage, and many others that are linked to it. I have always enjoyed web designing, since instead of it feeling like a task. It's more of a theraputic sensation. I can just freely create whatever I want, including the process of making this webpage.
    <br>
    Something interesting about me is that I love computers and when someone I know has a computer problem, it's pretty likely Iâ€™m the one they call for help. Because of this, my peers describe me as a dependable, well-organized, and trustworthy person.
    <br>
    After high school, I see myself going to college, specifically at Columbia University, majoring in either Computer Science or Mathematics. One day in the future I see myself as a programmer, coding and developing the functionality of future technology.
    <br>
    When I first started this course, I wasn't sure what to expect and I thought expectations were set way to high. This is because this course was considered an advanced placement class. We were expected to take the AP Exam for computer science, and I wasn't sure i'd be ready. This class with it's people helped me become comfortable and more confident in my ability. The teacher has been extremely helpful and a amazing guide.
    <br>
    In anyway this course has helped me collaborate with others and helped me develop my knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript. So take a while, and browse through my past webpages to the right, to look at previous work, and progress with me.</p>
